Like the author stated in his statement, I kind of want to setup my personal blog for quite a long time. However, it always got postpone for who knows whatever reasons. I install Ruby, Node.js, git, github and atom almost a year ago. But it is till today, I decided to write my very first blog. Hopefully I didn't put a lot of typo and grammar mistake.

I clone Gao Haoyang's blog template and try to figure out all the settings. I am totally a novice to this website thing.

For this very first blog, I changed the name of his repo to my github repo (from gaohaoyang.github.io to tianjunma.github.io). This is the name convention for github pages to build a website under your github root page. And this is also how the template author setup his personal blog. Then I pushed it to my github repo and started my very first baby blog. I also deleted his old posts and changed his footer a little bit, in order not to display the visit counts. Hopefully I will remember to keep update my personal blog.
