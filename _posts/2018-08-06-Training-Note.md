Today's training note started with a brief review about the X-ray production and corresponding basic concepts. I got a little bit rusted on all these topics. I did get the chance to see SBRT sim for a ped Lung patient. The therapists tried compression belt & 4D belt, bar/hoop and 4D belt only. The results for compression belt was bad, due to the nerveness of the our young patient's irregular breathing cycle. The reconstructed 4DCT got rugged body surface, due to the misbehavior of the breath trace. When applying 4D belt only, the patient felt more comfortable, and images were good, but with a relative large range of tumor motion. The physician decided to accept that. Other lung SBRT case was smooth. And OSMS case give you some thoughts about where to monitor patient's surface during treatment, especially for the chest region, limited motion was observed, compared to the belly region. We also got trained for an SBRT spine case. Due to historical reasons, we keep iPlan as one of the contouring system for our spine patient. The first phase is to fuse the image sets to get a planning image. Then, go to pinnacle. Try to use auto plan to generate a benchmark for later modification. The cost function and simulate annihilation were key concept in optimizer.

Today's training about a SBRT plan push through. Remember to check the location of the Txment note, also, about the any mask/fixation device that can cause the SSD number for setup beams (ASU/RSU/LSU) to not be accurate. Make a note on the Txment note, indicating where they were measured in Pinnacle system. Also, for HN patient, the couch needs to be removed, and any implant needs to be taken into consideration (overwrite the density). Rmember to assign the 2nd physics check. The OSMS for the abdomen monitoring results were actually not as good and constant as chest monitoring. Also, for the research part, pay attention to MOSAIQ.
