Watched a webinar from AAPM, talking about AI in Radiation therapy, given by Dr. Xing from Stanford. Kind of getting me think about my blog, which has been deserted for quite a while. Training is fun, and make me feel that time flies. I learned a lot of stuff, but also learning things take time. I got tons of notes to digest. Hopefully I can have some spared to organize them and posted here for fun.
