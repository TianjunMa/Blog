This entire month is about SBRT (sterotectic body radiation therapy). I watch two SBRT planning today (total of three). One liver, one prostate, one pancreas. The liver and pancreas were both a little bit tricky due to the surrounding OARs. Rings, objectives, and avoidance structures were created to make the plan confirmal and beautiful targeting the tumor and spare the normal tissue around it. The presicription was given specifically to each plan, Timmberman table can also be a great reference to check. 

Besides the SBRT plan, I was trying to write an automatic script for Pt QA plan generation. I wasn't too sure about the syntax and made a lot of mistakes. Trial and error methods isn't the most efficient way to learn a technique. But hopefully, I can learn this Pinnacle Scripting soon.
