I am not good at memorize things. I keep learning new stuff and forgetting old stuff. That's the reason I coded slow and usually with heavily marked comments.

I installed jekyll almost two years ago from now. And pretty slow in learning and fast in forgetting it.

The log for me to quickly setup the test environment on my desktop.

(1) Open a terminal and change the directory to the website folder [d:]
(2) type "jekyll build" then "jekyll serve"
(3) check the website from "localhost:4000"

Done. Not so hard to remember. Hopefully, I don't need to check my note often.
