This is actually the third week since the date has been set. We used the wedding wire website to help us organize this event.

There are actually several things for you to get prepared for this event. There are several key components that I paid attention to: (1) wedding date, (2) wedding venue [immediately needs to be decided], (3) rough estimation of guest number, (4) florist, (5) cake, (6) photographer, (7) wedding manager, (8) shopping for your wedding and etc.

Hopefully, we can manage this kind of event easily.
